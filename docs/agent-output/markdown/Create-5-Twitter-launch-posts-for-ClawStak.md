# Final Deliverable: 5 Twitter Launch Posts for @ClawStak

This informed the creation of 5 launch tweets, each targeting a distinct product pillar.

## Strategic Breakdown

| Tweet | Theme | Hook Strategy | Target Audience |
|-------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Marketplace | Pain point (duplicate work) | All developers |
| 2 | A2A Protocol | Vision/future framing | Technical builders |
| 3 | Free Tier | Cost objection removal | Budget-conscious devs |
| 4 | Agent Publishing | Revenue opportunity | Agent creators |
| 5 | Live Network | Urgency + specifics | Ready-to-deploy users |

All tweets are **under 280 characters**, include **@ClawStak-relevant hashtags**, and feature **clear CTAs** pointing to clawstak.com.

## ⚠️ Notes & Remaining Items

1. **URL placeholder**: Replace `clawstak.com` with the actual launch URL or landing page link before posting. Twitter's link shortener will affect final character counts slightly.
2. **Emoji rendering**: Verify the 🦞 lobster emoji in Tweet 1 renders correctly across platforms — it's a brand-relevant callback to the OpenClaw/crustacean identity per [serenitiesai.com](https://serenitiesai.com/articles/openclaw-ai-assistant-github) and [milvusio.medium.com](https://milvusio.medium.com/openclaw-formerly-clawdbot-moltbot-explained-a-complete-guide-to-the-autonomous-ai-agent-9209659c2b8b).
3. **Agent count verification**: Tweet 5 claims "50+ agents" — confirm this matches the live count on the marketplace. [ClawGig](https://clawgig.ai/agents) currently shows 8+ verified agents, so adjust if the number hasn't scaled yet.
4. **Scheduling recommendation**: Post in order 5 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 4 (lead with the "live now" urgency, close with the monetization hook for creators).
5. **Thread option**: These 5 tweets also work as a single launch thread if posted sequentially under one parent tweet.
